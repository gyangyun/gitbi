# Gitbi

_Gitbi_ is a lightweight BI web app that uses git repository as a source of saved queries, visualizations and dashboards. Everything is stored as text files which can be easily accessed and edited outside of the app (in addition to using web interface).

Features:

- You can write queries using either SQL or [PRQL](https://github.com/PRQL/prql)
- Interactive visualizations with [ECharts](https://github.com/apache/echarts)
- Mailing reports and alerts
- Currently supported DBs: clickhouse, duckdb (query csv files), postgresql, sqlite

Test it now with sample dbs and config:

```
docker run -p 8000:8000 pieca/gitbi:latest
```

See full deployment example: [ppatrzyk/gitbi-example](https://github.com/ppatrzyk/gitbi-example).

## Configuration

_Gitbi_ requires the following to run:

### Config repository

Repository needs to have the following structure:
- directories in repo root refer to databases
- files in each directory are queries/visualizations to be run against respective database
    - files with `.sql` or `.prql` extension are queries
    - (optional) files with `.json` extension are saved visualizations
- (optional) special directory `_dashboards` that contains dashboard specifications (`.json` format)
- (optional) README.md file content will be displayed on _Gitbi_ main page

### Configuration File

_Gitbi_ uses a YAML configuration file to manage all settings. The application provides a template file `app/config.yaml.template` that you can use as a starting point. You need to:

1. Copy the template file to create your own configuration:
   ```bash
   cp app/config.yaml.template app/config.yaml
   ```

2. Edit the `config.yaml` file with your actual settings.

You can also specify a different configuration file location using the `GITBI_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.

Example configuration file:

```yaml
# Repository configuration
repo:
  dir: /path/to/your/repo  # Repository directory path

# Database configuration
databases:
  db1:
    type: postgres
    connection_string: "postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/db1"
    
  db2:
    type: clickhouse
    connection_string: "clickhouse://user:password@localhost:9000/db2"
    
  db3:
    type: sqlite
    connection_string: "/path/to/db3.sqlite"
    
  db4:
    type: duckdb
    connection_string: "/path/to/db4.duckdb"

# Email configuration (optional)
email:
  smtp_user: your_smtp_user
  smtp_pass: your_smtp_pass
  smtp_url: smtp.example.com:587
  smtp_email: your_email@example.com

# Authentication configuration (optional)
auth:
  users:
    - user1:password1
    - user2:password2
```

Following database types are supported:

| Type       | Connection string format                                   |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| clickhouse | `clickhouse://[login]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database]` |
| duckdb     | path to db file (or `:memory:`)                            |
| postgres   | `postgresql://[userspec@][hostspec][/dbname][?paramspec]`  |
| sqlite     | path to db file (or `:memory:`)                            |

### Example

Assume you have repository with the following structure:

```
repo
├── _dashboards
│   └── my_dashboard.json
├── db1
│   ├── query1.sql
│   ├── query2.sql
│   └── query2.sql.json
├── db2
│   ├── query3.sql
│   ├── query3.sql.json
│   ├── query4.sql
│   └── query5.sql
└── README.md
```

There are 2 databases named _db1_ and _db2_. _db1_ has 2 queries, one of them has also visualization; _db2_ has 3 queries, 1 with added visualization. There is also one dashboard called _my_dashboard.json_.

For configuration you'd need to set up the following in your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
repo:
  dir: /path/to/your/repo

databases:
  db1:
    type: postgres
    connection_string: "postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/db1"
    
  db2:
    type: clickhouse
    connection_string: "clickhouse://user:password@localhost:9000/db2"
```

## Config formatting

### Visualization

Visualization is a JSON file with the following format:

```
{
  "type": "scatter|line|bar|heatmap",
  "xaxis": <column_name>,
  "yaxis": <column_name>,
  "zaxis": <column_name>,
  "group": <column_name>
}
```

### Dashboard

Dashboard is a JSON file with the following format, list can have any number of entries:

```
[
  [
    "<db_name>",
    "<query_file_name>"
  ],
  [
    "<db_name>",
    "<query_file_name>"
  ],
  ...
]
```

### Reporting

For every query, you have a _report_ endpoint that provides query results in html and text formats, as well as data only csv and json. This endpoint accepts two optional query parameters:

- `mail`: if this is not empty, gitbi will send an email with the result to specified address
- `alert`: if this is not empty, gitbi will send results via email only if there are some rows returned. Write your alert queries in a way that they usually do not return anything, but you want to be notified when they do. This parameter makes sense only together with email.

Scheduling is possible via any external service, most commonly CRON. Example:

```
# Report sent at 6am
0 6 * * * curl -s -u <user>:<password> <report_url>?mail=<your_email>

# Alert checked every minute
* * * * * curl -s -u <user>:<password> <report_url>?alert=true&mail=<your_email>
```

If you don't want to setup email credentials in _Gitbi_, you can still use CRON to to send reports with other tools. Examples:

```
# HTML report via sendmail
* * * * * echo -e "Subject: Gitbi report\nContent-Type: text/html\n\n$(curl -s -u <user>:<password> <report_url>)" | /usr/sbin/sendmail -f <sender_email> <recipient_email>

# HTML report via mailgun api
* * * * * curl -X POST --user "api:<mailgun_api_key>" --data-urlencode from=<sender_email> --data-urlencode to=<recipient_email> --data-urlencode subject="Gitbi report" --data-urlencode html="$(curl -s -u <user>:<password> <report_url>)" https://api.eu.mailgun.net/v3/SENDER_DOMAIN/messages
```

You can copy `report_url` from every query page.

## Repo setup

The easiest way to run _Gitbi_ is to set up a repository at the same server the app is running, and then sync changes into your local repo via ssh. This requires setting proper permissions for everything to work smoothly. Example setup:

```
# initialize as shared repo
# the command below allows any user in group <GROUP> to push into repo, for other options see https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init
git init --shared=group <REPO_NAME>
chgrp -R <GROUP> <REPO_NAME>
chmod g+rwxs <REPO_NAME>
# enable pushing to checked out branch
git config receive.denyCurrentBranch updateInstead
```

## Development

```
# install dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# run with sample repo
./start_app.sh

# run with testing repo
GITBI_REPO_DIR="./tests/gitbi-testing" GITBI_SQLITE_CONN="$(realpath ./tests/gitbi-testing/db.sqlite)" GITBI_SQLITE_TYPE=sqlite ./start_app.sh

# build image
docker build -t pieca/gitbi:<version> .
```
